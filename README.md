# Project Proposal 🗓

I am planning on designing and implementing an e-Commerce shopping application in Android that will allow end-users to register, login to the app and browse for products in different category sections. 

This application will currently have 4 pages of product categories that users can browse through and they are Sports & Outdoors, Tech, Clothing and DIY and once the users have chosen the products that they wish to purchase from category X, they can add it to their basket and proceed to the checkout. Customers can view the products added to the basket.

Before browsing for products, users are required to register and login into their account.

The main scope of this application is to allow end-users to shop for products in different categories, very similar to Amazon’s application.

After registration customers will receive a notification saying that they have registered successfully and the data from the registration will get sent to a back-end database. I will be making use of the Firebase Service to store the user’s registration data.

When customers have decided on what they want to purchase they can add the products to their basket and the users can view their basket in the form of a list view.

Users will be presented with a payment form where they are prompted to fill out their payment information and pay for the products chosen. After the payment is complete and processed users will receive an invoice through e-mail.

Each category with products will be shown on different activity pages on the application. For example, on page 1 the sports and outdoors category section will be displayed with the products available in stock etc.

I will be making use of version control using Git in order to track the changes made to the project and to also commit and push new changes when developing the application. In case I lose my work, I can revert back to previous commits to start from that checkpoint.

My initial inspiration for choosing this type of application was from the Amazon application.

I will be also making use of some Agile approaches such as Kanban Boards, Product Backlogs and Sprint Boards.

# Prerequisites

> Android Studio Installed

# Feasibility Study - Version 1.1 :open_file_folder:
In this section I will be writing about the different kinds of feasibility studies that will impact this project. These will determine whether this project is feasible enough to develop or not.

### Legal Feasibility :office: ###
> Under the Copyright Design and Patents Act, all of the images and source code that I will be using throughout this project I will reference in an index at the end of the project.

> Under the Data Protection Act all of the registration data will get stored in a secure back-end database using Firebase.

> Under the Computer Misuse Act, I will not any malware that will harm and render other people’s computer unavailable.

### Schedule Feasibility ###
> The total time taken for each task will be stated in a Gantt Chart and also the start and end dates for that task. The Gantt Chart will also show whether or not that task has been completed or if it’s still pending.

### Economic Feasibility ###
I will not be purchasing any software in order to achieve project completion, all of the software and tools that I will be using to develop this project will be free to use. No costs will be incurred.

### Technical Feasibility ###
I will be making use of my MacBook Pro to develop my project. The software that will be used are:

>	Android Studio: Where I will implement the User Interface 

>	Draw.io: Used to design the class diagrams using UML.

>	Zube: Used to implement Kanban Boards & implement the sprints for the project.

>	Firebase: Used to store the registration details of the customers.

>	Adobe XD CC: Used to design the User Interface of the application.

>	Survey Monkey: Used to gather data from end-users by creating a survey of 10 questions.

# Data Gathering - Questionnaire

## Homepage Activity Implementation ##

> ***How does it work?***

This is how the Homepage of the application looks like. Users who are on the application will be able to register an account by pressing the register button, then they will be taken to a form to fill out their details, after that they will be re-directed to the login page where they should login their account.

If users are having any issues then they can fill out a form on the Contact Us section of the app.

<img width="329" alt="Homepage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29733613/78153565-1accb980-7433-11ea-801b-217c7dd359eb.png">

## Register Activity Implementation ##

> ***How does it work?***

This is the Register activity of the application. Users can create an account by choosing a Username, Password and their e-mail. Once users click the Register button, they will receive a notification saying that they have registered successfully and the details will get written to a firebase database.

<img width="332" alt="Register UI" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29733613/78153578-1e604080-7433-11ea-80ea-7b59849d0388.png">

## Login Activity Implementation ##

> ***How does it work?***

This is how the Login Activity looks like. Users are required to log in with their registered e-mail address and password, the details must match with the ones they have registered with, otherwise they won't be granted access.

<img width="331" alt="Login" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29733613/78170576-0b596a80-744b-11ea-8db3-26627685f06a.png">

## Tech Activity Implementation ##

> ***How does it work?***

This is how the Tech Category Activity looks like. Users are able to choose a quantity, colour and size for each of the product and then add the product to the basket just like Amazon's shopping application. There is however a small issue, whenever a colour, quantity or size is chosen, it doesn't show up in the drop-down menu, this will be fixed in a later update.

<img width="336" alt="Tech Activity" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29733613/78153589-20c29a80-7433-11ea-8f24-eed4b3105e3c.png">

## Sports and Outdoors Activity Implementation ##

> ***How does it work?***

This is how the Sports and Outdoors Activity looks like. It has the same functionality as the other shopping categories, users can choose the quantity, colour and size of the product and then add it to the basket.

<img width="330" alt="Sports and Outdoors" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29733613/78227391-16e97780-74c5-11ea-9b48-d15e0e2a7671.png">

## Clothing Activity Implementation ##

> **How does it work?**

This is how the clothing activity looks like. It is the same as the other ones above.

<img width="336" alt="Clothing UI" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29733613/78227370-0f29d300-74c5-11ea-9271-005c8ca9e210.png">

## DIY Activity Implementation ##

> **How does it work?**

Same as the other ones above.

<img width="335" alt="DIY Activity" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29733613/78227382-14871d80-74c5-11ea-8c21-7377c4cb74f8.png">

## Contact Us Activity Implementation #

> **How does it work?**

This is how the Contact Us Activity looks like, the users that are experiencing issues with the application can fill out the form. After they have submitted the form, the data will get written to an SQL database where the data will get analysed and will be taken into consideration in order to figure out what needs to be fixed and updated, usually this will be in the **Maintenance** phase of the software development life cycle.

<img width="331" alt="Contact Us" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29733613/78227378-13ee8700-74c5-11ea-8ed5-7e8914081e05.png">

## Payment Activity Implementation ##

> **How does it work?**

This is how the Payment Activity looks like. After the users have chosen which products they would like to buy, they are presented with this form where they can pay for the products, just like on any shopping application. Users also have the option of paying with **PayPal**, however I would not recommend to actually go ahead and buy anything as this is only an application for myself for improving my skills and will not be uploaded on the play store.

<img width="329" alt="Payment Activity" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29733613/78227384-15b84a80-74c5-11ea-9de7-904621c2b566.png">
